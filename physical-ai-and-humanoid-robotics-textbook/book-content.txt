## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to thrive in human-centered environments because:

*   They can be trained using abundant real-world data
*   They represent the next stage of AI evolution:
    *   From digital intelligence → to embodied intelligence

Physical AI marks a shift from AI models confined to screens to intelligent systems operating in real physical space.

### The Latency Trap

Cloud simulation works well,
but controlling a physical robot from the cloud is unsafe due to latency.

**Solution**

*   Train models in the cloud
*   Download weights
*   Flash to local Jetson for real-time control
