# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
## Focus and Theme

**AI Systems in the Physical World — Embodied Intelligence**
This course bridges the gap between the digital brain and the physical body, enabling students to apply AI knowledge to control humanoid robots in both simulated and real environments.

## Quarter Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world.
This capstone quarter introduces Physical AI—AI systems that operate in real environments and understand physical laws.

Students will learn to:

*   Design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots
*   Use ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac
*   Develop systems capable of natural human–robot interaction
