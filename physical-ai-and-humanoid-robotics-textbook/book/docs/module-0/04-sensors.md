# Sensor Systems for Humanoid Robots

This section covers the essential sensor systems that allow humanoid robots to perceive their environment. A robot is only as good as its ability to sense the world around it. Let's dive into the most common types of sensors used in modern humanoid robots.

## LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)

LIDAR is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth. These light pulses—combined with other data recorded by the airborne system— generate precise, three-dimensional information about the shape of the Earth and its surface characteristics.

*   **How it works:** A LIDAR sensor emits laser beams and measures the time it takes for them to reflect off objects and return to the sensor. This "time of flight" is used to calculate the distance to the object.
*   **What it's used for:** Creating 3D maps of the environment, detecting obstacles, and localization (figuring out where the robot is).

## Cameras

Cameras are the "eyes" of the robot, providing rich visual information about the environment. Modern robots often use multiple cameras to get a 360-degree view and to perceive depth.

*   **Types of Cameras:**
    *   **Monocular Cameras:** A single camera, similar to a human eye. Can be used for object recognition, color detection, and tracking.
    *   **Stereo Cameras:** Two cameras separated by a known distance. By comparing the images from both cameras, the robot can calculate the depth of objects in the scene, similar to how human binocular vision works.
*   **What they're used for:** Object recognition, facial recognition, reading text, navigating using visual landmarks.

## IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units)

An IMU is an electronic device that measures and reports a body's specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers.

*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Accelerometer:** Measures linear acceleration (the rate of change of velocity).
    *   **Gyroscope:** Measures angular velocity (how fast the robot is rotating).
    *   **Magnetometer:** Measures the Earth's magnetic field, acting as a compass.
*   **What it's used for:** Crucial for balance and orientation. An IMU helps a humanoid robot know if it's upright, falling over, or turning.

## Force/Torque Sensors

Force/Torque (F/T) sensors measure the forces and torques applied to them. They are often placed in a robot's joints, wrists, or feet.

*   **How they work:** They use strain gauges that deform under load, changing their electrical resistance. This change is measured and converted into force and torque readings.
*   **What they're used for:**
    *   **Grasping:** Allowing a robot to hold an object with just the right amount of force, without crushing it or letting it slip.
    *   **Walking:** Measuring the forces between the robot's feet and the ground to maintain balance.
    *   **Safe Interaction:** Detecting unexpected collisions with the environment or humans.

## Accessing Sensor Data

In a robotics framework like ROS (which we'll cover in detail later), sensor data is typically published on "topics." You can then write code that "subscribes" to these topics to get a real-time stream of data.

Here's a simplified Python example of how you might access data from an IMU:

```python
import robotics

# Connect to the robot's sensor manager
sensor_manager = robotics.SensorManager()

# Subscribe to the IMU data stream
def imu_callback(imu_data):
    """
    This function is called every time new IMU data is available.
    """
    print(f"--- New IMU Reading ---")
    print(f"Orientation (Quaternion):")
    print(f"  x: {imu_data.orientation.x:.2f}")
    print(f"  y: {imu_data.orientation.y:.2f}")
    print(f"  z: {imu_data.orientation.z:.2f}")
    print(f"  w: {imu_data.orientation.w:.2f}")
    
    print(f"Angular Velocity (rad/s):")
    print(f"  x: {imu_data.angular_velocity.x:.2f}")
    print(f"  y: {imu_data.angular_velocity.y:.2f}")
    print(f"  z: {imu_data.angular_velocity.z:.2f}")

# Start listening for IMU data
sensor_manager.subscribe_to_imu(imu_callback)

print("Listening for IMU data. Press Ctrl+C to stop.")

# Keep the program running
robotics.spin()

```

This code sets up a "callback" function that gets executed automatically whenever a new piece of data arrives from the IMU. This is a fundamental pattern in robotics programming that we'll see again and again.
