# Foundations of Physical AI

This section lays the groundwork for understanding Physical AI and embodied intelligence.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are not confined to the digital world. Instead, they are embodied in a physical form, such as a robot, and can perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world. This is a significant step beyond traditional AI, which often operates on abstract data and in simulated environments.

The goal of Physical AI is to create autonomous agents that can perform complex tasks in unstructured, real-world environments. This requires a deep integration of AI with robotics, control theory, and sensor technology.

## Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence is the idea that intelligence is not just a property of the "brain" but emerges from the interaction between an agent's body, its environment, and its "brain" (the control system). The physical characteristics of an agent, such as its size, shape, and sensors, play a crucial role in shaping its intelligence.

For example, the way a humanoid robot with two legs and two arms perceives and navigates the world is fundamentally different from how a snake-like robot would. The embodiment hypothesis suggests that a physical body is essential for developing a deeper, more grounded understanding of the world.

This course will explore the implications of embodiment for AI and how to design intelligent systems that are truly "at home" in the physical world.
