# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

**AI Systems in the Physical World — Embodied Intelligence**

This textbook is your guide to the exciting world of Physical AI, where the digital minds we create learn to interact with and understand the physical world. We'll bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and robotics, giving you the tools to build and control intelligent systems that can see, act, and learn in real-world environments.

## About This Book

Dive into the transformative world where artificial intelligence meets physical embodiment. This textbook provides a comprehensive guide to understanding, designing, and deploying AI systems for humanoid robots, covering everything from fundamental concepts to advanced simulations and real-world applications.

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces Physical AI—AI systems that operate in real environments and understand physical laws.

## What You'll Learn

This course is designed to take you from the fundamentals of AI and robotics to the cutting edge of research and development. Here are some of the key concepts you'll master:

*   **Foundations of Physical AI:** Understand the principles of embodied intelligence and how robots perceive and interact with their environment.
*   **ROS 2 & Robotics Middleware:** Learn to use the Robot Operating System (ROS 2), the industry-standard software for building complex robotic applications.
*   **Advanced Simulation:** Master the art of creating digital twins of robots and environments using Gazebo and Unity for testing and training your AI.
*   **AI-Powered Robotics with NVIDIA Isaac:** Explore the powerful NVIDIA Isaac platform for developing AI-powered perception, manipulation, and navigation in robots.
*   **Humanoid Robot Development:** Delve into the unique challenges of humanoid robotics, including bipedal locomotion, balance, and grasping.
*   **Conversational AI:** Integrate large language models (LLMs) like GPT to create robots that can communicate and collaborate with humans naturally.

By the end of this course, you'll be able to:

*   Design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots.
*   Use ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac to build and test your creations.
*   Develop systems capable of natural human-robot interaction.
