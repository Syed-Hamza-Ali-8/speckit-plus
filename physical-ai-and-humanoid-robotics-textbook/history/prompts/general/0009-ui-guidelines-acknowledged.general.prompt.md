## Prompt

Use the design rules defined in @ui-guidelines.md for all UI work in my Docusaurus book ‘Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics’. Always style everything using TailwindCSS and follow the futuristic, clean, modern, scientific, tech-inspired theme described in the guideline file. Ensure the UI feels suitable for students and general readers, with consistent typography, spacing, and a professional robotics/AI visual identity in both light and dark modes. Whenever I ask you to modify, improve, upgrade, or create UI, automatically apply the guidelines from @ui-guidelines.md without repeating them back to me.

## Response snapshot

I have acknowledged the UI design guidelines and will apply them to all future UI work.
