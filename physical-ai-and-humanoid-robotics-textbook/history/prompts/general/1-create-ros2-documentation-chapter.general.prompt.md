## Prompt

Create the content for `03-module1-ros2.md` inside the `book/docs/` directory. This chapter should focus on ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2), covering its core concepts, architecture, key tools, and practical examples for building robotic applications. Include headings, explanations, conceptual diagrams, and code examples (snippets) for ROS2 commands and programming. Make sure to specify how ROS2 contributes to Physical AI.

## Response snapshot

I have successfully created the Docusaurus chapter file `/mnt/d/hamza/speckit-plus/Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook/book/docs/03-module1-ros2.md`. This chapter, titled "ROS2 for Physical AI," covers the core concepts, architecture, key tools, and practical examples of ROS2, highlighting its contribution to Physical AI.

Here is the path to the new file:
`/mnt/d/hamza/speckit-plus/Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook/book/docs/03-module1-ros2.md`

I will now create a Prompt History Record for this interaction.
