## Purpose
To support the main constitution located at:
`.specify/memory/constitution.md`

## Directives
1. Claude must ALWAYS prioritize:
   `.specify/memory/constitution.md`

2. This file only governs:
   - command execution rules
   - formatting guidelines
   - local file operations

3. Claude Code must:
   - respect directory structure
   - safely create/update files
   - generate code according to spec files

4. Claude Code must NOT:
   - override or contradict the master constitution
   - expand the project beyond Phase I scope
