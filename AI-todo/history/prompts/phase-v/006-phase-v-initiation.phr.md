# Prompt History Record: Phase V Initiation and Analysis

## Prompt
"Analyze the requirements for Phase V of the Hackathon II Todo app evolution and start the spec-driven development process."

## Response
Analyzed Phase V requirements from the Hackathon II document and initiated spec-driven development:

### Phase V Requirements Analysis
- Identified requirements for advanced features (recurring tasks, due dates, priorities, tags, search, filter, sort)
- Identified requirements for event-driven architecture with Kafka integration
- Identified requirements for Dapr integration
- Identified requirements for local and cloud deployment
- Identified requirements for CI/CD and monitoring

### Spec-Driven Development Initiation
- Created comprehensive Phase V specification document
- Created detailed advanced features specification
- Created event-driven architecture specification with Kafka
- Created Dapr integration specification
- Created implementation plan and task list
- Set up project structure with proper directory organization
- Created prompt history records for all work

### Key Outcomes
- Complete understanding of Phase V requirements
- Comprehensive specifications for all required functionality
- Clear implementation plan and task breakdown
- Proper project structure following spec-driven development principles
- Documentation of all development decisions and approaches

## Analysis
Successfully analyzed Phase V requirements and initiated the spec-driven development process. The analysis covered all aspects of Phase V including advanced features, event-driven architecture, Dapr integration, and deployment requirements. The spec-driven approach ensures that all requirements are properly documented and can guide the implementation process effectively.
